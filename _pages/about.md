**This page is currently underdevelopment.**

I earned my Ph.D. from Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory (IACL) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu) in 2024. My advisor is [Dr. Jerry Prince](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jerry-prince/). I was also a predoctoral research fellow at Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience of the National Institute on Aging from 2019 to 2023, under the supervision of [Dr. Susan Resnick](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/susan-resnick).
