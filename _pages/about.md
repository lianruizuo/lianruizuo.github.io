I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at [Medical-image Analysis and Statistical Interpretation lab (MASI)](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/) of Vanderbilt University. My PI is [Dr. Bennett Landman](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/bennett-landman/). I earned my Ph.D. from [Image Analysis and Communications Laboratory (IACL)](https://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/index.php?title=Main_Page) of Johns Hopkins University in 2024. My advisor is [Dr. Jerry Prince](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/jerry-prince/). I was also a predoctoral research fellow at Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience of the National Institute on Aging from 2019 to 2023, under the supervision of [Dr. Susan Resnick](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/susan-resnick).
