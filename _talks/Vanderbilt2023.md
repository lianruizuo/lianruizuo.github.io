- **Description:** In the pursuit of advanced patient care, medical imaging serves as an indispensable tool for understanding individual health and disease. However, the potential of this tool is often compromised by undesired variability due to the heterogeneity of data acquisition, posing significant challenges for medical professionals and translational AI algorithms. In the talk “From Voxels to Patients”, I will explore our approach and commitment to addressing these challenges, aiming to enhance the consistency of imaging data for improved patient care and analysis. I will present how our data-centric approaches can effectively mitigate undesired variations in medical data, thereby enriching both research and clinical applications of medical imaging. Our initiatives will be illustrated through a multi-site clinical trial for multiple sclerosis, where we demonstrate our comprehensive strategies: harmonizing images across diverse platforms, integrating multi-modal imaging, and managing varied data quality and availability. Audience will gain a deeper understanding of how these advanced techniques not only elevate the consistency and reliability of medical image analysis but also offer grand opportunities for improved patient care.
